Manual export of your Discord search results, page by page.

Features
Export messages page by page (no annoying rate limits)

Works in DMs, servers, group chats, whatever

How to use
Install the plugin (make sure you have ZeresPluginLibrary too)

Go to Discord's search tab

Use the buttons at the top of the results:

Export This Page: saves all messages currently loaded

Scroll to Bottom: loads more messages by scrolling down

End Export: saves everything you collected into a .txt file

Download
Just grab the plugin file from the plugin folder in this repo.

Known issues
Buttons might take a sec to show up after you search

You gotta manually scroll to load messages (Discord lazy loads them)

Exports only whatâ€™s currently loaded in the search results
